talk-python-gotchas-for-perl-programmers.txt contains a lightning talk
about common mistakes that Perl programmers make when coming to Python
plus ways to avoid those mistakes.

That file in an ad hoc Markdown-like format, but it's not strictly
Markdown. Just view it in a text editor with a fixed width font, like a normal
person. ;)

I hope it's helpful! If you have questions, please file a bug report
or email me.

Thanks,
